# GameOfLife
A CLI version of Conway's Game of Life

## How to Compile and run:
`gcc GameOfLife.c`
`./a.out`

## Context

This is another study in programming, primarily in getting better aquainted
with modular programming paradigms as a precursor to OOP.

Modularity is an important concept, because it means you can more easily 
update, improve and maintain your code. "Make code that's easy to delete." 
And this is an important concept to understand before you start tackling 
OOP. Otherwise your objects might get a bit co-dependent. 

But I'm speaking out of turn now. I hope to experience the rich tapestry 
that is OOP in the fullness of time.

One main reason to go with C in this case is to understand the root of a lot
of other languages and their various... excentricites. 

When you study Latin, Romance Languages are easier to grok.

Also the game of Life is freakin' cool.
